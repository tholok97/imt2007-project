# Repo for project in IMT2007 - Network Security

This is the repository we used to centralize our project work. It contains our LaTeX report, our Packet Tracer implementation, notes, and general artifacts from our project. As we used the repository in a kind of ad-hoc way, it is a little messy.

Read [the report](./submitted_report.pdf) for a full discussion of our project.

The repository was at commit 84463ee971195dfff1ed5e04b2f90be63c521b53 when the presentation was held.
